# Financial-QA-Webapp
This project is a web application that allows users to upload financial documents (Excel and PDF formats) and interactively query them using natural language.
The system extracts financial information such as revenues, expenses, and profits and provides answers to user questions in a conversational manner.

The solution is built with Streamlit for the web interface and integrates Ollama-powered local language models for question answering. It is designed for local hosting and does not require cloud deployment.
